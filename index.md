    <h4><b>Platform</b></h4>
    Pack your whole application into 20MB that starts in seconds by booting a lean, custom cross-compiled Linux directly to the battle-hardened Erlang VM.

    <div class="feature-box">
    <h4><b>Framework</b></h4>
    Let Nerves take care of the network, discovery, I/O, firmware updates and more. Focus on what matters and have fun writing robust and maintainable software.

    <div class="feature-box">
    <h4><b>Tooling</b></h4>
    Go from "mix new" to running code on your device in minutes. From cross-compilation to remote device access, our tools got you covered.

Nerves is young, but already powers rock-solid shipping industrial products!  Check us out if you are a hearty experimenter and interested in a new way of creating embedded systems.

Nerves is fully open source.  Nerves uses Buildroot to provide Linux, so some portions of the platform are licensed under the GPL.
