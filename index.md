    <h3>Platform</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Pack your whole application into as little as 12MB and have it start in seconds by booting a lean cross-compiled Linux directly to the battle-hardened Erlang VM.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>Framework</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Let Nerves take care of the network, discovery, I/O, firmware updates and more. Focus on what matters and have fun writing robust and maintainable software.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>Tooling</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Go from "mix new" to running code on your device in minutes. From cross-compilation to remote device access, our tools got you covered.

<h3>Hardware Support</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>Nerves supports many popular prototyping boards such as the Beaglebone Black and Raspberry Pi family. If a board can run embedded Linux (not uClinux), it likely can run Nerves.</p>
