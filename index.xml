If you are responsible for any software at scale in recent years you have likely heard of software supply chain as a topic. This is not just a cloud native buzzword but is in fact an industry-wide buzz .. I mean term. There is a ton of work happening across the world on SBOM, licensing and compliance for a few reason.</description></item><item><title>The Erlang SSH CVE, of course</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2025-04-25-the-erlang-ssh-cve-of-course/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2025-04-25-the-erlang-ssh-cve-of-course/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Hopefully you've been reached about the Erlang security issue&amp;nbsp;for the SSH app. It hits&amp;nbsp;all Erlang versions&amp;nbsp;and fixes are available for recent versions. It is about as bad as vulnerabilities come in terms of scope. Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution.
This is relevant to all Nerves systems and you should update immediately. You may have already mitigated the real risk if you turn off nerves_ssh&amp;nbsp;for production systems or if your systems run in internal networks and only communicate via VPN.</description></item><item><title>Tickets available at your local Internet</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2025-02-27-tickets-available-at-your-local-internet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2025-02-27-tickets-available-at-your-local-internet/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Two NervesConfs in the same year. Unheard of!
Todd Resudek has been the person behind NervesConf and ran the US one. After NervesConf US he suggested that if I (Lars Wikman) wanted to put one on in Europe where I operate I very much could. So I did. NervesConf EU tickets are on sale!
And of course that doesn't stop the US one.</description></item><item><title>Inference on devices?</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2025-02-14-inference-on-devices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2025-02-14-inference-on-devices/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Project UpdatesDid you know that NervesHub has a CLI tool? It hasn't been heavily promoted. Probably because it was kind of rough. But it is very useful.
I've seen that people using NervesHub don't initially hear about the CLI so I figure it deserves a moment.
I have used it heavily for demos of NervesHub in my talks.</description></item><item><title>Announcing NervesConf EU</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2025-01-15-announcing-nervesconf-eu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2025-01-15-announcing-nervesconf-eu/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Project UpdatesThe Nerves Project can be followed on Bluesky&amp;nbsp;and on the Fediverse. This newsletter is probably the best place to get the official updates but we try to surface cool projects on socials. Best place to ask questions and get help is the Nerves section of the Elixir Forum.
Updates
nerves_hub_link, v2.6.0
This update includes Extensions, a mechanism to handle extensions on a device for custom data and/or reporting outside the firmware update mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Did you know about the car?</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-11-21-did-you-know-about-the-car/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-11-21-did-you-know-about-the-car/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Project UpdatesThere are system updates coming to match the nerves_system_br changes but I believe they are on hold as Frank found some really odd, fun problems related to GCC 14.2.0 and ARM 32-bit devices. It would have a negative impact on a bunch of RPi devices as well as many production devices in use today. That's my understanding.</description></item><item><title>Teasing the near term</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-10-24-teasing-the-near-term/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-10-24-teasing-the-near-term/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Teasers vs ReleasersWith most of the active core team being in Berlin the previous week the github-tooling to pull together a report says nothing happened. Nothing at all. Which might be accurate in terms of tagged releases but there are definitely things happening.
One exciting teaser is this PR that heavily revamps the NervesHubCLI project to make it a standalone tool that does not require living as a dependency.</description></item><item><title>Core updates, brace for systems :)</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-10-10-core-updates-brace-for-systems-/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-10-10-core-updates-brace-for-systems-/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Lost knowledgeThe Nerves core team are making the same move that Ash Framework recently did where we shift our answering of questions and troubleshooting to be on the forum. The goal of this is to build up a knowledge-base that doesn't scroll away into Slack's hidden history or Discord's app-only archive. We want Nerves to be findable via Google.</description></item><item><title>NervesHub 2.0.0, finally :)</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-09-26-nerveshub-2.0.0-finally-/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-09-26-nerveshub-2.0.0-finally-/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

State of Nerves surveyPlease&amp;nbsp;take this survey:&amp;nbsp;https://nerves-project.typeform.com/sotnn-2024
It is put together a bunch of us that operate in the community and ecosystem to get a sense of how Nerves is used. It will inform ideas and decisions that are on the very near-term agenda for Nerves and ventures around Nerves.
If you are using Nerves, have used Nerves, want to use Nerves we want your input.</description></item><item><title>Simulating circuits and many system updates :)</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-04-11-simulating-circuits-and-many-system-updates-/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-04-11-simulating-circuits-and-many-system-updates-/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Project updates&amp;nbsp;
nerves_system_br, v1.27.0
This update pulls in Buildroot 2024.02. This is a major Buildroot update.
Nerves systems need the following updates:
For Raspberry Pi systems using libcamera, the version that comes with Raspberry Pi OS has diverged from upstream libcamera. To use it, replace&amp;nbsp;BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCAMERA_*=y&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;BR2_PACKAGE_RPI_LIBCAMERA_*=y.The Raspberry Pi applications for libcamera also changed. Replace&amp;nbsp;BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCAMERA_APPS=y&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;BR2_PACKAGE_RPICAM_APPS=y. The upstream package is called&amp;nbsp;rpicam_apps.</description></item><item><title>System updates &amp; some TFLite?</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-03-04-system-updates--some-tflite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2024-03-04-system-updates--some-tflite/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Project updatesQuestion for y'all in the community and industry. What dev boards with ML accelerators on them have y'all been using or looking at?

World updatesIf you've at all missed it. The Raspberry Pi 5 has been announced!
Headline features are the invention of the power button and something called a real-time clock.
Snark aside, whether it is worthwhile for your projects will depend on a lot of things.

Welcome back to the Nerves Newsletter. Apologies for the short break. I took the liberty of cancelling an issue as I was running a fever and suffering from logistics when I would have normally put it together. This kind of makes this one a banger though so strap in.

Project updatesproperty_table, v0.2.4
Editor's note: I had not seen property_table before and you might not have either. From the README:
In-memory key-value store with subscriptions
PropertyTable makes it easy to set up a key-value store where users can subscribe to changes based on patterns. PropertyTable refers to keys as properties. Properties have values and are timestamped as to when they received that value.</description></item><item><title>Vacation catchup edition</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2023-08-17-vacation-catchup-edition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2023-08-17-vacation-catchup-edition/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Things are calm across the Elixir landscape at the moment. And that means mostly calm in Nerves land as well. I think vacations are coming. I know that's the case here in Sweden.

Official project updatesnerves_system_br, v1.23.0
This update pulls in Erlang/OTP 26.0 and Buildroot 2023.02.1. For the Buildroot portion, most projects that work with&amp;nbsp;nerves_system_br&amp;nbsp;v1.22.x shouldn&amp;#8217;t need any changes with this update, but please review the Buildroot release notes.
Upgrade notes
The default TERM setting changed from vt100 to xterm-256color. In the past, this didn&amp;#8217;t really matter. With OTP 26, the TERM setting starts being used so applications that use the terminal may change how they render.</description></item><item><title>TFLite and NervesHub 2.0</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2023-05-29-tflite-and-nerveshub-2.0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2023-05-29-tflite-and-nerveshub-2.0/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

This update includes adding TFLite (TensorFlow Lite) to Nerves Livebook by default for supported devices (most of them). With all the ML hype I would be curious to hear if you are experimenting or have plans to/desires in that direction for your use of Nerves.

&amp;nbsp; Official project updatesSince this update brings Nerves Heart 2.0 further into use I will re-post the 2.0 changes from the previous edition here before we resume the changelog.
The heart is, if you didn't know, the friendly helper that keeps your device alive if Erlang actually fails. It is the supervisor of all supervisors. It is the Nerves replacement for the Erlang heart module.</description></item><item><title>ElixirConf talks and Code BEAM happened!</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-11-14-elixirconf-talks-and-code-beam-happened/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-11-14-elixirconf-talks-and-code-beam-happened/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

&amp;nbsp; Official project updatesI've been travelling and getting the newsletter out turned out to be too painful. Frank threw me some updates as I delayed this newsletter. I'll consider them official gospel and share them verbatim. I quote:
&amp;quot;New Neres systems, new Nerves Livebook, new Circuits Quickstart. Code BEAM was awesome!&amp;nbsp;@floralouise&amp;#8217;s Puppeteering presentation w/ Nerves Livebook, @kikuyuta&amp;#8217;s use of Nerves in small hydroelectric plants in Japan, @takasehideki&amp;#8217;s autonomous node communication w/ ROS and Nerves, and @Jason Axelson&amp;#8217;s Nerves in the cloud.</description></item><item><title>Systems and sparks metered</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-10-27-systems-and-sparks-metered/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-10-27-systems-and-sparks-metered/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

&amp;nbsp; Official project updatesAfter conference time pushed all pending development out into public I guess we're in for a bit of quiet. Not a bad time to take a breath, get ready for autumn, sip som tea. My github-slurping-machine finds a single update.
As this is a very brief issue I want to invite all the readers to also make sure you are in the #nerves Slack and I'd love to get your thoughts on this discussion prompt:</description></item><item><title>NervesConf 2 completed, now buy books :)</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-09-15-nervesconf-2-completed-now-buy-books/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-09-15-nervesconf-2-completed-now-buy-books/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

&amp;nbsp; Editor's note: We should now be back to our non-vacation cadence. Good to be back.
I also have a question from Frank Hunleth to the industrial users of Nerves, he is collecting some guidance for future choices. I hope this is not too late to be useful as I missed getting it into the previous one:</description></item><item><title>Less american, more mango and RISC-V</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-07-22-less-american-more-mango-and-risc-v/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-07-22-less-american-more-mango-and-risc-v/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

&amp;nbsp; Nerves 1.8 is out with an announcement and everything. Read that for the high-level overview and context.
Constraints make for creative exploration. A new device gets early support in Nerves. The MangoPi MQ Pro. It is designed as a Pi Zero competitor or alternative but like most non-Raspberry Pi it is not software-compatible and as such it will not be quite as sweet from the start.</description></item><item><title>Erlang OTP 25 systems, ARM 64 JIT</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-07-07-erlang-otp-25-systems-arm-64-jit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-07-07-erlang-otp-25-systems-arm-64-jit/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

&amp;nbsp; Editor's note: The baby and the toddler are both asleep. Time to update y'all on Nerves! Lots of Buildroot updates and such. I expect next update will be a hailstorm of board systems.
This newsletter will continue to be uneven. I got a very gracious offer to help keep it on schedule but the practicalities of it would been a major hassle so uneven it shall be.</description></item><item><title>OTP 25</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-05-26-otp-25/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-05-26-otp-25/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

&amp;nbsp; Editor's note: I'm going on parental leave (newborn incoming) and you might get a big ol' gap in the newsletter.

&amp;nbsp; Official project updatesThe Nerves core team gathered up and has been working on some improvements. Frank has mentioned documentation&amp;nbsp;getting some focus. I'm excited to see what comes of it :)
circuits_quickstart, v0.4.15
Support WiFi configuration when making the MicroSD card when using&amp;nbsp;fwup. Thanks to @mnishiguchi for this.
nerves_livebook, v0.6.0
Update Livebook to&amp;nbsp;v0.6.1
vintage_net_wizard, v0.4.8
VintageNet Wizard is a very neat way to set up wifi for a new device by letting your user connect to it and help it with wifi configuration.</description></item><item><title>QMI, Stockholm and companies shipping with Nerves</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-04-28-qmi-stockholm-and-companies-shipping-with-nerves/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-04-28-qmi-stockholm-and-companies-shipping-with-nerves/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

This release has two potentially breaking changes:
Elixir 1.11 is now the minimum supported Elixir version.VintageNet.PropertyTable&amp;nbsp;has been extracted to its own library and is now just&amp;nbsp;PropertyTable. Most users did not use&amp;nbsp;VintageNet.PropertyTable&amp;nbsp;directly, but if you did, you&amp;#8217;ll need to update the references.ChangedExtract&amp;nbsp;VintageNet.PropertyTable&amp;nbsp;to its own library.

&amp;nbsp; Official project updatesOne of our great Nerves maintainers, Frank Hunleth, gave me a bit of an update for this one.
It was discovered that uncompressed .beam files are more efficient for Nerves projects than compressed ones. This is due to them otherwise being compressed again in the firmware image (I believe that's squashfs). So this does a few things, more efficient overall compression, so smaller firmware images and faster boot times due to reducing the number of zlib calls for decompressing those .</description></item><item><title>GRiSP 2, meetup talks and Outlaws</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-03-03-grisp-2-meetup-talks-and-outlaws/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-03-03-grisp-2-meetup-talks-and-outlaws/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

&amp;nbsp; Official project updatesSo GRiSP2 board support is in progress, you'll see plenty of it in the below changelog. I'll just briefly outline the slightly nuanced relationship between the board and Nerves. The absolutely coolest thing about GRiSP2 in my eyes is that it provides a bare-metal Erlang virtual machine. Your processes and messages, all in hardware.</description></item><item><title>A fancy video</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-02-17-a-fancy-video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-02-17-a-fancy-video/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

&amp;nbsp; Official project updatesA video was made. So I (Lars, editor) have wanted to do this for some time. A fun demo of getting started with Nerves. So I had my company Underjord do it. No doubt I will benefit immensely from this marketing effort. Or maybe it is mostly a labor of love. It is a short (One minute, 38 seconds) demonstration of doing your first steps with Nerves Livebook.</description></item><item><title>Meetup goes hard, Analog-to-Digital and Livebook updates</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-02-03-meetup-goes-hard-analog-to-digital-and-livebook-updates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/newsletter/2022-02-03-meetup-goes-hard-analog-to-digital-and-livebook-updates/</guid><description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> No images?

The product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark. Only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service. The organization using the mark must do nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.</description></item><item><title>Videos</title><link>https://nerves-project.org/videos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nerves-project.org/videos/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
