> NOTE: As of June 2016, Bake is no longer the best way to build firmware with Nerves. Check out [this news update](http://nerves-project.org/news/2016/05/29/a-whirlwind-of-recent-changes/#mix-integration) for more details on the native Mix integration for Nerves.

One of the most common questions I see on the nerves Slack room has to do with "how to get started" and "are there any samples that build?"  I'm happy to say, the answer is "yes".

The [nerves-examples](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-examples) project aims to be the repository of simple examples you can use to test out your nerves build environment and get started.

Right now there are only a couple examples, but as we roll out more functionality in Nerves, the list will grow.   All of these examples are setup to properly build using [bake](http://bakeware.io), and some of them are setup to do custom per-target configuration.  

If you have a good idea for an example, please feel free to implement and send me a pull request.
