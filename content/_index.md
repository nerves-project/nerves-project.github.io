  Elixir ❤️ Embedded
aboutNerves: |
  **Nerves** is an open-source platform that combines the rock-solid BEAM virtual machine
  and Elixir ecosystem to easily build and deploy production embedded systems.
getStartedURL: './getting_started'
introduction: |
  Hardware doesn't have to be hard. Nerves makes edge computing easier by solving
  the most complex infrastructure problems. Let Nerves take care of the network,
  discovery, I/O, firmware updates, and more. Focus your team on what matters —
  writing robust and maintainable software.
features:
  - name: Portable
    image: img/portable.svg
    description: |
      Nerves runs out-of-the-box on commonly available hardware. Nerves
      leverages Linux and Buildroot to minimize the effort to port to other
      devices.
  - name: Lean
    image: img/scalable.svg
    description: |
      Nerves uses Elixir Mix releases to include only the code you need. Most
      Nerves ports provide a Linux kernel and runtime with the basics so that
      you build up rather than trim down. Firmware sizes start in the 20-30 MB
      range.
  - name: Reliable
    image: 'img/high-reliability.svg'
    description: |
      Nerves uses the
      [Erlang runtime system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)),
      known for being distributed, fault-tolerant, soft real-time, and highly
      available. Nerves firmware is immutable so you know exactly what software
      is running.
  - name: Secure
    image: 'img/secure.svg'
    description: |
      Avoid hidden bugs and vulnerabilities with Nerves' secure opt-in approach
      to building. Nerves starts minimal and provides regular security updates
      to Erlang and Linux components. SBOM information is available via the
      Buildroot integration.
  - name: Efficient
    image: img/agile.svg
    description: |
      Take advantage of Erlang and Elixir's I/O optimizations such as IOData
      that minimize data copies over the entire stack. Thanks to common
      abstractions, much of the ecosystem uses these features already.
  - name: Extensible
    image: 'img/extensible.svg'
    description: |
      Nerves is just one part of the vibrant Elixir ecosystem. Take advantage of
      other Elixir projects like Phoenix, Nx, Livebook and more in embedded
      projects.

      - Simple strategy for building reliable programs
      that's consistent through the whole language and ecosystem
        - There's really only one way to build things and it involves message
        passing to fine-grained lightweight processes that are monitored and
        recovered via supervision trees
        - No other language or ecosystem has such
      consistency here and it gives confidence that the blast radius from
      failures is contained
      - Virtual machine with fine-grained Garbage collection (GC)
        - You get the benefits of a higher level language without the GC cost
